# Pylon Launcher
Pylon launcher is an extensible video game launcher powered by Go and Lua. It 
is intended to be the singular program you need to launch any of your games.

"Launcher Plugins" are written in Lua and provide one or more games to be 
displayed in the launcher. Multiple launch configurations, or "profiles", will 
be supported, as well as signing into and launching games with multiple 
external accounts.
